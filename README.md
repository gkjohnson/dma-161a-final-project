**Spring 2011 UCLA D|MA 161A Network Media Class Final Project**

Final "portfolio" project for a web media class in D|MA 161A. I used the project as an opportunity to learn canvas and learn how to implement a game and render loop in javascript.

This class was my first introduction to Javascript and handwritten HTML and CSS. We've come a long way!
