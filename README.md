# dma-161a-final-project
**Spring 2011 UCLA D|MA 161A Network Media Class Final Project**

Final "portfolio" project for a web media class in D|MA 161A. I used the project as an opportunity to learn canvas and learn how to implement a game and render loop in javascript.

This class was my first introduction to Javascript and handwritten HTML and CSS. We've come a long way!

## Code Update

The original project only ran at 25 frames per second, so I updated the code to get it running at 60fps and changed the colors and UI a bit, as well. The original state of the project can be found [here](../../tree/original-version)!

## Controls
```
WASD, Arrow keys            Move
Mouse click                 Fire

1-4                         Switch to weapon
Q, /                        Change weapon
P                           Pause
